//! Which engine the callback runs, and switching between them mid-flight.
//!
//! For a long time this decision did not exist: the callback was a grain
//! scheduler and nothing else, so choosing WSOLA or the vocoder in the
//! interface changed the exported file and never changed what came out of the
//! speakers. The picker looked like a performance control and was not one.
//!
//! Every engine that can run here is held at once, built when the device opens
//! and never allocated again. That is not thrift — an engine built on demand is
//! an allocation in the audio callback, and switching engines is exactly the
//! moment you least want a dropout.
//!
//! Only the engine that is selected is asked for audio. The others keep
//! whatever state they had, which is why a switch has to re-seek the one being
//! switched *to*: it may have been sitting at a position from minutes ago, or
//! never have run at all.
