//! The audio callback must not allocate. Proven, not promised.
//!
//! Every streaming engine here claims to allocate nothing once built. That
//! claim is the difference between playback and a dropout, it is invisible in
//! review, and it is the kind of thing a single `vec![]` added in a hurry
//! quietly breaks. So it is measured: a counting allocator wraps the system
//! one, and the count is read either side of a render.
//!
//! The count is global and every test in this binary shares it, so there is
//! exactly one test here. Two would race each other's measurements and the
//! result would depend on how many threads cargo happened to use — a test that
//! passes or fails for reasons unrelated to what it is testing.
