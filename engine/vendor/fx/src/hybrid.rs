//! Three methods on three parts of the same sound.
//!
//! The other engines each pick one compromise and live with it. The vocoder is
//! right about a held chord and wrong about a snare; WSOLA is right about the
//! snare and smears the chord; both are wrong about hiss, which neither can
//! stretch without repeating. Every one of them is applying a single method to
//! material that is not one thing.
//!
//! So separate first. [`crate::decompose`] splits the input into partials,
//! attacks and everything else, and each part goes to the method that suits it:
//!
//! | Part | Method | Because |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | Harmonic | phase vocoder | partials keep their phase relationship |
//! | Percussive | WSOLA | an attack survives being placed, not interpolated |
//! | Residual | noise morphing | fresh noise shaped like the old, so nothing repeats |
//!
//! Then sum. The parts are a partition of the original spectrum, so at a ratio
//! of one the sum is the original — there is a test for it, and it is the check
//! that the routing has not quietly gained or lost a part.
//!
//! This is the most expensive engine here by a wide margin: two spectrogram
//! passes for the separation, then a vocoder, a WSOLA and a morph. But the
//! separation does not depend on the ratio — splitting a sound up is a property
//! of the sound, not of what is being done to it — so it happens once, off the
//! audio thread, and after that this engine runs in the callback like the rest.
//! See [`crate::hstream`].
