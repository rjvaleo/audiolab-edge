//! The vocoder, stopped periodically and put back on the ground.
//!
//! A phase vocoder's error is cumulative. Each frame's phase is guessed from
//! the last one's plus the frequency it measured, and each guess is slightly
//! wrong, so over a long stretch the partials drift out of the relationship
//! they had with each other. That is the phasiness — the hollow, reverberant
//! quality that says *vocoder* before it says anything about the material. It
//! gets worse the longer the stretch runs, which is exactly the case the
//! vocoder is otherwise best at.
//!
//! PVSOLA (Moinet and Dutoit, DAFx-12) fixes it by not letting the drift
//! accumulate. Run the vocoder for a handful of frames, then stop trusting the
//! propagated phase entirely: go back to the input, take a raw segment, find
//! where it best continues what has been written using WSOLA's similarity
//! search, cross-fade it in, and start the vocoder again from there with its
//! phase reset to that segment's actual phase.
//!
//! What comes out is the vocoder's tonal handling with a time-domain anchor
//! every few frames, so nothing has long enough to drift. The cost is one knob
//! nobody wants: re-anchor too often and the WSOLA splices dominate and the
//! transients start doubling; too rarely and the phasiness comes back. Four to
//! eight frames is the paper's range and the default sits inside it.
//!
//! This is built on top of the two engines rather than beside them. The
//! vocoder runs on segments of the input; the splice search is the same
//! normalised correlation WSOLA uses. Both keep their own extended parameters,
//! so everything that breaks them on purpose still breaks this.
