//! Phase vocoder time stretching.

//! The frequency-domain counterpart to WSOLA. Where WSOLA cuts the signal up
//! and hunts for splice points that happen to line up, this transforms each
//! window, works out what frequency each bin *really* holds, and advances the
//! phase by what that frequency implies over the synthesis hop rather than by
//! what the analysis hop happened to give it. The magnitudes are copied
//! untouched; only the phases are rewritten.
//!
//! That difference decides where each belongs. WSOLA is phase-coherent by
//! construction and keeps transients intact, but on dense polyphony there is no
//! single splice point that suits every pitch at once, so it smears. The
//! vocoder has no such trouble with polyphony — every partial is handled in its
//! own bin — but it smears transients across a window and gives noise a watery,
//! chorused quality, because forcing phase coherence on noise is precisely the
//! wrong thing to do to it. They fail in opposite directions, which is why the
//! app now offers both rather than picking one.
