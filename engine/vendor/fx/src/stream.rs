//! Stretching a block at a time, for the audio callback.
//!
//! The engines in this crate were written as whole-buffer renders: hand them a
//! file, get a file back. That is the wrong shape for playback. An audio
//! callback is handed a few hundred frames, must return before the device wants
//! them, and must not allocate on the way — so an engine that needs the whole
//! input before it can produce the first sample can only ever be heard by
//! rendering it first and playing the result.
//!
//! A streaming engine keeps its own state between blocks instead. WSOLA's is
//! small and obvious: where it read from last, where it is writing to, and the
//! stretch of waveform it expects to follow what it just laid down. Everything
//! else it needs is either in the source or in the parameters.
//!
//! Two rules shape everything here, and both are load-bearing.
//!
//! **No allocation once built.** Every buffer is sized at construction from the
//! widest settings the controls allow, not from the current ones, because the
//! current ones can change between two blocks and a resize in the callback is a
//! dropout. Anything that genuinely must allocate — the transient map, which is
//! computed from the whole file — is built on the caller's thread and handed
//! over, the same way the rack is.
//!
//! **The offline render drives the same streamer.** `stretch::wsola` is now a
//! loop over this, so "what you hear is what you export" is true by
//! construction rather than by a test that has to be remembered. If the two
//! ever disagree it is a bug in one caller, not a difference between two
//! algorithms.
