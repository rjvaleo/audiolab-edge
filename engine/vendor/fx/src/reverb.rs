//! Comb-and-all-pass reverberation, from the papers that defined it.
//!
//! Two complete reverberators:
//!
//! - **Schroeder** — parallel combs into series all-passes. The first digital
//!   reverberator (Schroeder 1961/62), as set out in Moorer's Fig. 2b and
//!   re-implemented in Dornean, Ţopa and Kirei, *Digital Implementation of
//!   Artificial Reverberation Algorithms*.
//! - **Moorer** — the same shape with a one-pole low-pass **inside each comb's
//!   feedback loop**, simulating the absorption of air. James A. Moorer, *About
//!   This Reverberation Business*, Computer Music Journal 3(2), 1979, pp.
//!   13–28. Delay lengths and coefficients are his Table 2.
//!
//! This is a different family from `dattorro`'s plate. The plate is one
//! recirculating tank read at many points; these are banks of independent combs
//! summed together. They fail differently, which is the reason to have both: a
//! comb bank has a pitch to it that a plate does not, and a plate has a
//! metallic sheen that a comb bank does not.
//!
//! **The stability trick is Moorer's** (p7). Each comb's loop gain is set to
//! `g₂ = g(1 − g₁)`, where `g` is shared by every comb and `g₁` is that comb's
//! damping. Written that way the loop cannot be driven unstable by turning the
//! damping up, which is exactly what independent decay and damping controls
//! let you do — and `g` alone then reads as the reverberation time.
