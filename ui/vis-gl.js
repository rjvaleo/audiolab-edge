///
/// * `depth` — how far the room runs back, as a multiple of the distance to its
///   front face. This sets how strongly it converges: the back face draws at
///   `1 / (1 + depth)` of the front one.
/// * `floorY`, `ceilY` — where the floor sits below the eye and the ceiling
///   above it, at the front face. **Their asymmetry about zero is the camera
///   angle.** The frustum is shifted rather than the camera tilted, which is
///   what puts the vanishing point above the middle so the floor is visible at
///   all, while the front face still lands exactly on the canvas edges.
/// * `shiftX` — the same trick sideways. Zero is the vanishing point centred.
/// * `skyAt`, `ring` — where the Lissajous hangs up the room, and how big it
///   is, both as fractions of the room's height. Taken from the height and
///   never the width, which is what keeps it round at any aspect.
