// The stage: one room, one scene, everything in it.
//
// See `docs/PORT-PLAN.md`. This is the rebuild — not another visualiser beside
// the others but the room they are all going to end up living in, with real
// light in it, real air, and objects that can see one another.
//
// **Built beside what works, not on top of it.** Nothing in here touches
// `vis-gl.js`, `ridge.js` or `room3d.js`; it is another entry in the registry
// until it is better than they are. That is not caution for its own sake — it is
// the only way a rebuild of this size does not spend its first week with the app
// broken.
//
// ── what is different from everything before it ──
//
// Every visualiser this program has had draws **lines that emit their own
// light**: additive blending over black, no lamps, no surfaces, no air. It is a
// good look and it is the only look those renderers can do. The room is a
// wireframe because a wireframe is what you get when nothing is lit.
//
// This has lights. Which means it also has to have **materials that answer
// them**, **surfaces for light to land on**, and **air for it to travel
// through** — the three things the old room fakes. Its fog is a distance-shade
// applied per vertex; here it is the scene's own fog, so a thing far away is
// actually further away. Its mist is a sprite trick; here it is particles with
// positions and lifetimes. Its walls are four lines; here they are surfaces that
// catch the key light and fall off into the dark.

/// The room, the camera, the light, the air.
