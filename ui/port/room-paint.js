// The room's palette: what every drawn thing is coloured with, and what that
// colour is read against.
//
// See `docs/ROOM-PAINT.md`.
//
// The room shipped with three colours — `--wave-2`, `--wave` and `--accent` —
// driving fifteen of its eighteen draw calls, and two of those three are the
// same colour in the palette that ships. So the grain wires, the grain bloom
// and all three mist passes were a gradient between a colour and itself, and
// the ring, the skin, the terrain and the leading edge were four objects
// painted identically. This is what takes them apart.
//
// **Nothing here is a colour on its own.** Every mark in this room already has
// a number behind it — how loud that band is, how far back that grain has
// travelled, how wide the stereo image is at that point of the ring — and the
// old two-colour mix was a ramp read against one of them. So a slot is not a
// swatch: it is a ramp, a choice of what to read it against, and the window of
// that quantity to spend it across.

/// Every paintable thing, in the order the panel lists them.
///
/// `row` is its line in the ramp atlas — see `VG_RAMP_ROWS` in `vis-gl.js`.
/// The two with no row are not drawn in the scene: the data block is type on
/// the back wall and the background is the ground the glass sits on, so both
/// are CSS rather than geometry.
///
/// `own` names the quantity that layer offers beyond the ones every layer has.
/// Loudness, height, depth, distance and a per-mark random are varyings already
/// and cost nothing; this is the one thing each layer knows that would
/// otherwise be thrown away.
